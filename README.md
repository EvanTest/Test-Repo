# Test-Repo
Test Repo for playing around with Git things.  This is the main, upstream Repo.  But I can't guarantee this description won't be inherited by Forks.


OH MAN, I am totally Editing this README.md.  This is being done on the new local branch I just made called “CrazyTestBranch”.  When I push this to my forked repo, I’m going to call it a different branch “SaneTestBranch”.
